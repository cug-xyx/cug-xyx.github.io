## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Yuxuan Xie, currently a PhD student at Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on evapotranspiration (ET) and landâ€“atmosphere interactions within the field of eco-hydrology. I'm passionate about scientific programming, especially with R, Python, and Julia, and I enjoy developing efficient packages for data analysis and model simulation.
